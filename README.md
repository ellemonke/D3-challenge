# D3-challenge
Here is an example of an interactive scatter plot made with the **[D3.js library](https://d3js.org/)** and uses [2014 Census Data](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). It plots combinations of three demographic properties against three behavioral risks. The chart includes state labels and tooltips with percentage information. If an axis label is clicked, the plots will animate to their new location. The size of the chart is also responsive based on window size. The [JS file](assets/js/app.js) utilizes D3 grouping, linear scaling, [Justin Palmer's D3-tip plug-in](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip), and functional programming.
